The custom enchants can be gained via the /enchanter menu, or through villager trades. Custom enchants have a specified item that they can be used on along with a chance of success. The success percentage is the chance that it'll be applied to the item. If it doesn't succeed the book will break.

### Commands:

* /enchanter:
  * Opens the menu to purchase custom enchant books.
* /alchemist:
  * Opens the alchemy menu.
* /tinkerer:
  * Opens the tinkering menu.
