Soltide offers a few ways to get support, all with unique purposes, so make sure to reach out the right way to get the support you deserve! Make sure to read through the docs to make sure your question isn't already answered here!

## Discord

#### Tickets:

Tickets are generally used for specific issues relating to you (I.E. Inventory Rollbacks), for issues relating to the server (Bug reports), and for player reports. To make a ticket, join our [Discord](https://soltide.net/discord?direct) and navigate to the Tickets channel.

#### Support Channel:

The support channel is an open channel for you to ask general questions that can be answered quickly.



## E-Mail

E-mail support is generally **only** used for purchase support, staff reports, and legal notices. We recommend contacting us through Discord for most other situations. Should you need to contact us through E-Mail, please do so at [soltide@pbsi.xyz](mailto:soltide@pbsi.xyz).
