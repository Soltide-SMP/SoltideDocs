# TPA Trapping / Killing

{% hint style="info" %}
TPA stands for "Teleport Ask" and is the command that lets you teleport to another player with their permission. To use TPA type `/tpa <username>`  and `/tpaccept` to accept an incoming teleport.
{% endhint %}

#### TPA Trapping:

Restraining a player within an area with the intent of restricting their ability to travel is disallowed. Furthermore, you cannot intentionally teleport a player into an area which would result in their death, whether it be a custom built spike pit, the battle arena, or a natural pool of lava. It is up to the discretion of the moderator reviewing the case whether or not something constitutes as TPA trapping.

#### TPA Killing:

You may not engage in combat with intent to kill a player if they've recently teleported to you. Furthermore, having a your teammate attempt to kill the player that has recently teleported to you will result in a punishment for _both_ you and your teammate if it was planned in advance. If your teammate starts to attack a player not realizing that you had teleported them, you _must_ attempt to notify them. If they continue your teammate will receive a punishment.&#x20;

#### Exceptions:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Rules against TPA Trapping / Killing do not apply after 3 minutes have elapsed since the player was teleported.
{% endhint %}

You may kill a player who has teleported to you IF:

* They attempt to attack you first (A singular punch doesn't count, it has to be repeated and/or with a weapon).
* They attempt to destroy your base (Breaking a singular block doesn't count, they have to either break several blocks, attempt to use explosives, or attempt to burn it down).
* They attempt to rob you. This includes taking items from chests or breaking valuable blocks.&#x20;
