# Inventory Restoration

{% hint style="info" %}
Inventory restorations will not be given due to client side disconnects, or as a result of punishments (unless the punishment was successfully appealed).
{% endhint %}

### What qualifies for an inventory restoration?

If you die as a result of a server side issue (**NOT** client side- your internet connection's stability is of your own responsibility), teleportation trap / kill (See [here](rules/tpa-trapping-killing.md) for more info) , or as a result of a hacker you _may_ be able to reclaim certain items.

### What can my inventory be restored from?

Your inventory can be restored from your last login / logout or your last death. The date recorded closest to the time before the incident will be used. Your inventory, armor, and EXP levels can all be restored if they were impacted.

### How do I request an Inventory Restoration?

If you qualify for an inventory restoration and you've read you agree to the [conditions](inventory-restoration.md#conditions), you may request an inventory restoration of either your full inventory and EXP, or specific things. To do so, please make a ticket in our [Discord](https://soltide.net/discord?direct). It is _highly preferred_ that you provide video evidence of the incident if possible. If you lack video evidence you may request we review the logs to validate your request but you will need to provide a **near exact timestamp**, to figure this out we recommend you look through your Minecraft chat logs and provide us the timestamp and timezone which your logs would indicate.&#x20;

### Conditions

Before requesting an inventory restoration you must agree to the following conditions:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that upon submitting an inventory restoration request you are bound to these conditions and you may receive a punishment for violating a condition.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* An inventory restoration is _**NOT**_ guaranteed and is handled on a case to case basis.&#x20;
* You must submit a Inventory restoration request as soon as the incident occurs! The longer you wait the lower the chance a restoration is possible. If your request was made more than 24 hours after the time you lost your items, you are not eligible for a restoration. &#x20;
* You _**CANNOT**_ use the inventory restoration process to duplicate items.
  * When requesting a restoration you _**must**_ disclose any items you were able to regain.
  * If you discover any items later on you _**must**_ disclose them to a staff member ASAP.
  * Certain items have anti-duplication measures which if triggered from a duplication and you fail to disclose said item it may result in an account reset.
* You cannot request the restoration of features that were not affected.
